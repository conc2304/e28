## Notes for instructor
I would have liked to set up dependency injections. Maybe next project.
I tried a few times to write this in typescript to try to learn it but it proved a bit too much.


## Build Setup

``` bash
# From /p2 directory

# install dependencies
npm install


# serve with hot reload at localhost:8080
npm run dev

# build for production with minification
npm run build

# build for production and view the bundle analyzer report
npm run build --report
```
